## Predicting Pressure Application

#### Coursera Project. Developing Data Products Course

This application can fit a prediction model by a smoothing spline to the supplied data. It predicts vapor pressure values of mercury from given temperature values. 

The bs function of the spline package and a range of degrees of freedom from 3 to 10 values have been used.  

Estimate Adjusted R Squared, which is a metric for evaluating the goodness of fit of the model.
