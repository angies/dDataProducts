## Predicting Pressure Application

#### Coursera Project. Developing Data Products Course

This application can fit a prediction model by a smoothing spline to the supplied data. It predicts vapor pressure values of mercury from given temperature values. 

The bs function of the spline package and a range of degrees of freedom from 3 to 10 values have been used.  

Estimate Adjusted R Squared, which is a metric for evaluating the goodness of fit of the model.

- The supplied data are from pressure dataset package <https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/pressure.html>
- The web App is available <https://ae2015.shinyapps.io/predict_pressure/>
- A supporting presentation can be viewed <http://rpubs.com/angies/56017>.
